NEEDS

Every living system, object, or thing has needs, which are essential for its survival, growth, and well-being. Needs refer to the necessary conditions, resources, or actions that a living system requires to maintain its functions and achieve its goals. Needs can be both physical and non-physical and can vary depending on the type of system, object, or thing.

Classifying Needs

In “living systems,” the “needs” can be classified into several basic categories, such as food, water, oxygen, shelter, and sleep. These are the primary needs required to sustain life and ensure the organism’s survival. In addition to these basic needs, living systems also have social, emotional, and intellectual needs, which contribute to their well-being and quality of life.

System Functionality

The functionality of any system or thing is determined by its needs. For instance, a plant needs sunlight, water, and nutrients to photosynthesize and grow, and without these needs, it cannot carry out its function of producing food. Similarly, a car needs fuel to power its engine and move, and without fuel, it cannot function.

System Operability

The operability of a system or thing is also determined by its needs. If the needs are not met, the system or object may not operate correctly or may stop functioning altogether. For example, a computer system may crash if it does not have enough memory or processing power to handle the programs it is running.

In simple and complex living systems, “needs” refer to the essential requirements that must be met for the system to function properly. These needs can range from basic physiological needs, such as food, water, and oxygen, to more complex psychological and social needs, such as safety, belongingness, and esteem.

In technical systems, needs can also refer to the essential requirements that must be met for the system to function properly. For example, a computer system may have needs such as sufficient processing power, memory, storage, and a reliable network connection.

Meeting these needs is critical for the survival and success of the system. If a living system’s needs are not met, it may experience physical and mental health problems, reduced productivity, and other negative consequences. Similarly, if a technical system’s needs are not met, it may experience performance issues, downtime, and other technical problems.

One example of how needs are important in non-technical systems is in Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, which outlines the different levels of needs that humans require for optimal functioning. According to Maslow, the most basic needs are physiological needs, followed by safety, belongingness, esteem, and self-actualization needs.

In technical systems, needs are often addressed through system design and engineering. For example, a computer system may be designed with sufficient processing power, memory, and storage to meet its performance needs. Network systems may be engineered to ensure reliable connectivity and data transfer speeds to meet the needs of the system.

Understanding the needs of living systems is essential to understanding human behavior and how we interact with our environment. There are numerous theories, models, systems, and schools of thought that attempt to explain these needs, ranging from the physiological to the psychological and social. Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs, for example, is a widely recognized theory that describes human needs in five levels, starting with the most basic physiological needs and progressing to self-actualization. Other models, such as Self-Determination Theory, Attachment Theory, and Behavioral Economics, offer different perspectives on how human needs and motivations influence behavior. Meanwhile, approaches like Evolutionary Psychology, Bioenergetics, and Cybernetics delve into the biological and ecological underpinnings of human needs and how they are met.

Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs: This is a theory that describes human needs in five levels, starting with physiological needs (such as food and water) and progressing to safety, love and belonging, esteem, and self-actualization.

Self-Determination Theory: This theory posits that humans have three basic needs: autonomy (the need to control one’s own life), competence (the need to feel capable), and relatedness (the need to feel connected to others).

Evolutionary Psychology: This approach looks at how human needs evolved over time, and how they are rooted in our biology and history as a species.

Attachment Theory: This theory suggests that humans have a fundamental need for close relationships, and that early attachment experiences shape our ability to form and maintain these relationships throughout life.

Ecological Systems Theory: This model looks at the various systems and environments in which individuals operate, and how they influence each other to shape human needs and behaviors.

Bioenergetics: This theory focuses on the energy needs of living systems, and how they are met through food, oxygen, and other resources.

General Systems Theory: This interdisciplinary approach looks at the commonalities among living and non-living systems, and how they operate through feedback loops, hierarchy, and other principles.

Cybernetics: This model examines the ways in which living systems regulate themselves, and how they use feedback to maintain homeostasis and adapt to changing environments.

Behavioral Economics: This approach combines psychology and economics to explain how human needs and motivations influence decision-making, and how they are shaped by social and cultural factors.

Humanistic Psychology: This school of thought emphasizes the importance of subjective experience, and the need for individuals to find meaning and purpose in their lives through personal growth and self-actualization.

The “Distributed Sequencing Network” is a “Living System”

Therefore…

The Distributed Sequencing Network has NEED(s)

ALL Need(s) of the Distributed Sequencing Network

If we view humanity with a holistic lens, it is easy to insinuate +/or determine that…

Humanity is a “Complex Intersequenced Living System”

Therefore, humanity can only function and operate at its fullest capacity and to its fullest ability when all of its parts (humans) are.

IF the basic needs of ALL Human Being(s) ARE NOT met, then the complex living system of humanity will fail (or cease to exist)

IF the basic needs of ALL Human Being(s) ARE met, then the complex living system of humanity will survive (and even thrive)

If we view humanity as a complex and intersequenced living system, we can begin to see the critical importance of ensuring that the basic needs of all human beings are met. Each individual human is a crucial component of this system, and the well-being of the whole depends on the well-being of each part. Just as a complex machine cannot function properly if even one of its parts is broken or malfunctioning, so too humanity cannot operate at its fullest potential if any of its members are lacking in the basic necessities of life (Maslow Protocol). The “survive and thrive” essence of humanity as a living system is contingent upon the mutual distribution of resources, the fulfillment of fundamental human rights, and the recognition of the inherent value of each human life. In short, humanity must prioritize meeting the basic needs of all individuals if we are to sustain and improve the complex living system that is our species.
